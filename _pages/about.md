Welcome to my personal website!

I am a postgraduate student at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), 
majoring in Data Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.

I have recently embarked on my research journey 
in the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I am particularly interested in applying NLP to Social Sciences, 
aspiring to contribute to building a better society through this field.

Currently, I am delving deeper into research 
and actively seeking opportunities for research internships and pursuing a PhD or MS/PhD.

Finally, I would like to thank 
who have accompanied and helped me in my life and work, 
especially my senior, [Hongbin Na](https://hongbin-ze.github.io/) and [Zimu Wang](https://www.zimuwang.net/), 
for their patient and professional advice and pleasant collaboration.
