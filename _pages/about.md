Welcome to my personal website!

I am a postgraduate student at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), 
majoring in Data Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.

Under the patient and professional mentorship of my senior, [Hongbin Na](https://hongbin-ze.github.io/), 
I have recently embarked on my research journey in the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

I am particularly interested in applying NLP to Social Sciences, 
aspiring to contribute to building a better society through this field.

Currently, I am delving deeper into research 
and actively seeking opportunities for research internships and pursuing a PhD.
